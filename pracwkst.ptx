        <p>
         For what values of A and B, if any, does the system have (a) an infinite number of solutions? (b) no solutions? (c) exactly one solution?
        </p>
      </introduction>
      <me>x_1 + 2x_2 = 1</me>
      <me>Ax_1 + Bx_2 = 2</me>
    </exercise>
    <p>
        For the case where there are an infinite number of solutions, sketch the set of solutions. Note that sketches need to have labeled axes. The set of solutions should be a line that does not have arrows. </p>

               Sketch any two points on the line. In this class we will always put x1 on the horizontal axis.

               Construct a linear system of equations so that the line is the solution set. Use at least two equations. How many equations could you have in your system?

               If the point <m>(a, b)</m> is any point in the solution set, is the point <m>(ka, kb)</m> also in the solution set for any real number k?
