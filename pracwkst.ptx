<m>{\large\textbf{1.1 Studio Organization}}</m>
  <p> This worksheet is a bit shorter than most other worksheets to give time to discuss course and studio
organization. We will discuss:</p>

  <p>
    A) What are studios? How are they different from lectures?

      <m>{\large\textbf{1.2 Linear Systems}}</m>
      <p>A <m>{\textbf{linear system}}</m> is a set of linear equations. An example of a linear system with two equations is</p>
      <me>x + 3y = 4</me>
      <me>5x + 6y = 5</me>
      <p>We might want to know:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>what values of the unknowns satisfy all equations in the system, if any?</li>
        <li>what procedure do we want to use to identify those values?</li>
      </ul>

      <exercise workspace="1in">
          <introduction>
        <p>
         For what values of A and B, if any, does the system have (a) an infinite number of solutions? (b) no solutions? (c) exactly one solution?
        </p>
      </introduction>
      <me>x_1 + 2x_2 = 1</me>
      <me>Ax_1 + Bx_2 = 2</me>
    </exercise>
    <p>
        For the case where there are an infinite number of solutions, sketch the set of solutions. Note that sketches need to have labeled axes. The set of solutions should be a line that does not have arrows. </p>

<exercise workspace="1in">
          <introduction>
        <p>
          Consider the line <m>x_2 = 2x_1</m>.

      <task>
            <statement>
              <p>
               Sketch any two points on the line. In this class we will always put x1 on the horizontal axis.

               Construct a linear system of equations so that the line is the solution set. Use at least two equations. How many equations could you have in your system?

               If the point <m>(a, b)</m> is any point in the solution set, is the point <m>(ka, kb)</m> also in the solution set for any real number k?
